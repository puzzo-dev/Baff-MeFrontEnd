Design and build a futuristic, Nike-style frontend for an ultra-modern fashion e-commerce brand called Baff-Me.

Brand Personality: Baff-Me is bold, edgy, and trend-forward, focused on casual and street-style fashion for both juniors and seniors. Think urban vibe, clean layout, high contrast, and strong visual identity.

Design Aesthetic:

Visuals similar to Nike's modern product pages: minimal, immersive, strong use of whitespace, crisp typography, and motion.

Animations and transitions using Framer Motion or Tailwind CSS transitions for a smooth, polished experience.

Responsive design with mobile-first layout, optimized for Gen Z and millennials.

Dark/light theme toggle (based on system preference).

Product cards with hover effects, 360Â° view, color swatches, and quick-add options.

Core Pages to Include:

Homepage: Hero banner with model shots, new arrivals, and featured collections.

Product Listing Page (PLP): Grid with filters, size/color selectors, quick views.

Product Detail Page (PDP): High-res images, video support, size guides, reviews, upsells.

Cart & Checkout Flow: Streamlined, frictionless, mobile-friendly with clear CTAs.

Account Dashboard: Order history, saved items, size profile.

Style Journal or blog-style content section.

Admin CMS hooks: Integrate with MedusaJS collections, product categories, promotions, etc.

Tech Stack & Requirements:

Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion

Backend: MedusaJS (headless commerce)

State Management: Zustand or React Context

API Integration: Fully dynamic product, cart, user auth, and checkout flows with MedusaJS REST or GraphQL API

Use Server Actions and RSCs for optimal performance on Next.js 15

Include SEO best practices, OG tags, structured data

Support for i18n and accessibility (WCAG 2.1)

Output a modular and scalable codebase, with reusable components, layouts, and hooks. Follow best practices for file structure, TypeScript typing, and performance optimizations.

Use Nike.com and Adidas.com as style references, but make sure the Baff-Me brand has its own unique, confident voice that appeals to fashion-forward urban youth and young adults.
